# Business Idea Generator POC - Functional Scope

## Project Overview

### Purpose
This POC demonstrates a multi-agent AI system that generates and evaluates business ideas based on user preferences. The system employs a sequential multi-agent pattern where each agent specializes in a specific aspect of business idea analysis.

### Value Proposition
- **Automated Ideation**: Generate creative business ideas that leverage current technology
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: Multi-dimensional scoring across disruption, market potential, technical complexity, and capital requirements
- **Market Intelligence**: Competitive landscape analysis with extensive web research
- **Critical Analysis**: Balanced evaluation with realistic assessment of challenges
- **Structured Documentation**: Professional output format for decision-making

### High-Level Functionality
The system processes hardcoded business preferences through four specialized agents in sequence, ultimately producing a ranked list of business ideas with detailed analysis and recommendations.

## Functional Requirements

### FR1: Business Idea Generation
- Generate 10 detailed business ideas based on input preferences
- Each idea must include:
  - Descriptive title
  - Detailed operational description
  - Clear business model explanation
- Ideas should leverage current technology but represent novel applications

### FR2: Multi-Dimensional Scoring
- Score each business idea across four key dimensions (0-10 scale):
  - **Disruption Potential**: How revolutionary the idea is
  - **Market Potential**: Size and accessibility of target market
  - **Technical Complexity**: Development and implementation difficulty
  - **Capital Intensity**: Financial requirements to launch
- Provide detailed reasoning for each score

### FR3: Competitive Analysis
- Conduct extensive web research (minimum 25 sources per idea)
- Identify existing companies with similar products/services
- Generate "Blue Ocean Score" (0-10) indicating market whitespace
- Provide supporting evidence and reasoning

### FR4: Critical Evaluation
- Perform skeptical analysis of each business idea
- Research potential challenges and obstacles
- Generate "Overall Score" (0-10) with balanced assessment
- Provide evidence-based reasoning for final evaluation

### FR5: Professional Documentation
- Generate structured markdown report
- Include individual tables for each business idea
- Provide processing statistics and metadata
- Highlight top 3 recommendations in summary
